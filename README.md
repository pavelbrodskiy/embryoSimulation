# Summary
I generated this code in a 1-week sprint to generate preliminary simulation data for a grant proposal as a proof of concept. This simulates growth and development at a cell-level of a small region of a developing fly embryo. The morphogens wingless and EGFR are also simulated. The model assumes advection occurs uniformly in growing cells and accounts for dilution.
